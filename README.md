# The minecraft VR modpack

---

### INSTALLATION

To install this modpack, simply download the [repo](https://github.com/Sodukene/MinecraftModpack/releases/latest) page. **Unzip it in a safe place like the documents folder**

Once you've done that, download the vivecraft installer
\
	[Non-VR](https://github.com/jrbudda/Vivecraft_112/releases/download/1.12.2-jrbudda-7/vivecraft-1.12.2-jrbudda-NONVR-8-r5-installer.exe)

Once downloaded, run it, you need to tick **Install Vivecraft with Forge**

**Enable custom version and enter:** `14.23.5.2825`

Under create Vivecraft launcher profile, you can adjust how much RAM you want to give it. And you can also change the name of the profile for when you load it on the launcher.

**Make sure the modpack option is ticked**, then select the **minecraft folder** on where you extracted it, in my case it'll be: C:\Users\Jonathan\Documents\MinecraftModpack\minecraft

Then click install, and **MAKE SURE** you install forge alongside the installation when it pops up. You don't have to modify any settings here.

Now that you installed it, you can launch the game via the default Minecraft Launcher and it'll be a profile you can use.

I do not own the original rights to this modpack. It's originally a FTB modpack called the FTB Ultimate Reloaded modpack with a few additional modifications to the pack. **All credits go towards them and the mod creators. I'm simply doing this for a group of friends so we can easily update/change the modpack as we play**
